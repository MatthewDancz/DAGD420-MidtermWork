Trig Visualizer
---------------
This Sketch shows off how different trigonometry elements are used in game programming, and serves as a tool to help teach visually how the differing trig functions relate to one another.

Vector Visualizer
-----------------
This Sketch shows off different Vector components. The user is able to create vectors on the screen and manipulate their data to see how vectors can be used in game programming.
